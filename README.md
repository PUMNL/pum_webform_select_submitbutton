# PUM Webform Select list as Submit Button

Transform a select list to individual submit buttons on a webform.

For example this is used on the Assess Project Request by Representative webform. 
There we have the status of the projectrequest as a select list with either Approve or Reject. 
Both options are transformed to buttons on the webform and the default submit button is removed from the form.

## Instructions

Edit the webform and edit the component which is a select list and check the option 'Display as  submit buttons'.
